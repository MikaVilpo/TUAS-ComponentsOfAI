# TUAS Components of AI Assignment

This folder contains all the files required for the TUAS Components of AI assignment. Below is an overview of the file organization and their purposes:

* [Train_MobileNetV2.ipynb](Train_MobileNetV2.ipynb): Model training notebook MobileNetV2.
* [Train_Xception.ipynb](Train_Xception.ipynb): Model training notebook for model Xception.
* [comparing_keras_models.ipynb](comparing_keras_models.ipynb): Notebook comparing different Keras models for this usecase.
* [webcam-predictor.py](webcam-predictor.py): Script to follow webcam feed, detect faces and do predictions
* [MobileNetV2.keras](MobileNetV2.keras): Trained MobileNetV2 model for hat detection.
* [dataset -folder](./dataset/): Folder containing training pictures classified to train, validation and test sets
* [webcam-collector.py](webcam-collector.py): Tool to collect images for training
* [clean_image_names.py](clean_image_names.py): Tool for fixing filenames in dataset.

Xception.keras model file is too big to fit in repository (~250MB).
For TUAS users, model is available in: <https://tuas365.sharepoint.com/:u:/s/ComponentsandApplicationsofAI/EawlXzfbCY1FqojoBk10idgBbwLg5H1DBIE-ML0zoMDifg?e=vctnLT>
